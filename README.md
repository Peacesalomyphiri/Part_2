Other Features

This app also lets a user enter the number of ingredients, the quantity of the ingredient, the calories the ingredient has and also calculates the total number of the calories and if they exceed the limit, a warning message is displayed to let the user know. 

It also allows the user to enter the number of steps involved when it comes to the recipe they added. It also displays the steps and does not leave out any.

When the user enters a number of recipes, and wants to display the list of recipes, it shows the recipes in alphabetical order.
